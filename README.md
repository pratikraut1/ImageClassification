# The classifier for trying out is available here : https://malaria-detection-cells.herokuapp.com/
This is a very simple web app which classifies whether the cells are parasitized(infected) or uninfected.
The dataset is avaliable on kaggle competitions : malaria-cell-images

The sample images for malaria cells :


<img src ='u.png' width = '500' height = '500'>


The confusion matrix which is calculated on the validation set is :


<img src = 'cm.png' width = '500' height = '500'>
